# AI SEO Page Rewrite — Executive Summary

**Date:** December 16, 2025  
**Page:** https://www.webvello.com/services/ai-seo  
**Objective:** AEO optimization while supporting (not competing with) the Answer Engine Optimization service page

---

## 🎯 STRATEGIC APPROACH

### Core Positioning
**AI SEO is a methodology, not a service category.**

The rewrite positions AI SEO as:
- A **tool-based enhancement** to traditional SEO
- The **"how"** (using AI within SEO workflows)
- **Complementary** to AEO (which is the "what" — content format)

This positioning ensures AI SEO **supports** the AEO service page by clarifying that they serve different purposes within a comprehensive search strategy.
