# AEO Service Page Rewrite: Executive Summary

**Date:** December 16, 2025  
**URL:** https://www.webvello.com/services/answer-engine-optimization  
**Status:** ✅ Complete & Production-Ready

---

## Mission Accomplished

The Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) service page has been comprehensively rewritten to serve as an **AI-citable authority** on what AEO is, how it differs from related services, and when businesses need it.

---

## Core Achievement: AI Citability

### BEFORE
Content was marketing-focused but not quotable by AI systems:
- Vague definitions ("specialized practice of optimizing")
- No differentiation from SEO, GEO, or AI SEO
- Generic process descriptions
- No structured data

### AFTER
Content is now directly quotable by AI systems:

**Example 1 - Definition:**
> "Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of structuring website content to appear in featured snippets, Google answer boxes, and voice assistant responses."

**Example 2 - Differentiation:**
> "SEO optimizes for clicks; AEO optimizes for immediate answers that appear above organic results."

**Example 3 - Process:**
> "Webvello implements AEO through a four-step process: question research, content structuring, schema markup implementation, and performance monitoring."

## What Changed

### 1. Clear Entity Definition ✅
- **First sentence** defines exactly what AEO is

Added explicit comparisons:

- When should a business invest in AEO?
- What content works best for AEO?
- How long to see results?
- How does Webvello implement AEO?

### 5. Comprehensive Schema Markup ✅
Implemented 5 schema types:
- Service Schema (defines AEO offering)

- WebPage Schema (page metadata)
- BreadcrumbList Schema (navigation)
- OfferCatalog Schema (4 service steps)

**Impact:** Rich results eligibility, better AI extraction

### 6. Step-by-Step Process Detail ✅

| Step | What Changed |
|------|--------------|

| **3. Schema** | Added: "FAQ schema, HowTo schema, structured data validation" |
| **4. Monitor** | Added: "tracks featured snippet wins, answer box appearances, monthly reports" |

### 7. Low-Pressure CTA ✅
