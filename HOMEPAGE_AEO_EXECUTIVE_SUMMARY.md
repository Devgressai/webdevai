## ❓ FAQ About This Project

### Q: Will this hurt our existing SEO?
**A:** No. All changes support existing SEO strategy. We're adding entity clarity and FAQ content—both proven to improve rankings. Internal linking strengthens your pillar page authority.

### Q: How long until we see AI engine citations?
**A:** 1-3 months typically. AI engines need to crawl, index, and incorporate the new structured content. ChatGPT and Perplexity are fastest (30-60 days), Google SGE takes longer (60-90 days).

### Q: Do we need to change anything on service pages?
**A:** Not immediately. The homepage now properly supports your service pillar pages. You can apply the same AEO principles to service pages later as a Phase 2.

### Q: What about the fake review rating we removed?
**A:** Good catch! The 4.9/5 rating with 500 reviews violated schema safety rules (no verified review system). We removed it to avoid potential Google penalties. You can add it back once you implement a verified review collection system.

### Q: Can we test this before going live?
**A:** Yes! Deploy to a staging environment first, test with Google Rich Results Test, verify in ChatGPT/Perplexity, check mobile responsiveness, then push to production.
