## 🎓 The Psychology

**Why fewer leads = more revenue:**

1. **Self-qualification** - Only serious prospects apply
2. **Pre-framing** - They expect premium pricing
3. **Perceived value** - Exclusivity increases worth
4. **Less friction** - No price objections
5. **Better clients** - Longer relationships, more referrals

**The "Velvet Rope" Effect:**
- People want what they can't easily have
- Being selective makes you more desirable
- Premium positioning allows premium pricing

---

## 📞 Sales Team Updates

### When Applications Come In:

1. ✅ **Review within 48 hours** (keep promise)
2. ✅ **Qualify first** - Do they meet criteria?
3. ✅ **Reject politely** if not qualified
4. ✅ **Schedule call** 3-5 days out (not immediate)
5. ✅ **Position as evaluation** (mutual fit)

### On Sales Calls:

- Start with qualifying questions
- Discuss budget early
- Position yourself as selector
- Don't chase or discount
- Walk away from bad fits
