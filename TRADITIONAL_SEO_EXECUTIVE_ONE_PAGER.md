## 🏗️ NEW SERVICE POSITIONING

- Clear positioning as infrastructure
- Explicitly enables AI SEO and AEO
- Complementary, not competitive

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  AEO (Featured Snippets)        │ Layer 3
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│  AI SEO (Acceleration)          │ Layer 2
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│  Traditional SEO (Foundation)   │ Layer 1 ← This Page
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Message:**  
Traditional SEO doesn't compete with AI SEO or AEO—it enables them.
