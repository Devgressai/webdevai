# Cleanup Old Sitemaps - Google Search Console

## Current Status ✅

**Working Sitemap:**
- URL: `https://www.webvello.com/sitemap.xml`
- Status: **Success** ✅
- Discovered pages: 9,123
- Last read: Oct 26, 2025

**Old Failed Sitemap:**
- URL: `https://webvello.com/sitemap.xml` 
- Status: **Couldn't fetch** ❌
- Discovered pages: 5,687
- Last read: Oct 22, 2025

## Recommended Action

**Delete the old failed sitemap:**

1. Go to Google Search Console: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Navigate to: **Sitemaps** (left sidebar)
3. Find the entry for `https://webvello.com/sitemap.xml`
4. Click the **3-dot menu** (⋮) next to it
5. Click **"Delete sitemap"**
6. Confirm deletion

This will:
- ✅ Keep only your working sitemap
- ✅ Remove confusion in GSC
- ✅ Clean up your sitemap list
- ✅ Google will use the working one (`https://www.webvello.com/sitemap.xml`)

## Why This Matters

Having both sitemaps:
- Creates duplicate signals
- One is failing, one is working
- Clutters your GSC dashboard
- The old one (`https://webvello.com` without `www`) is outdated

## You're Done! 🎉

Your sitemap is now:
- ✅ Successfully being fetched by Google
- ✅ 9,123 pages discovered
- ✅ Status: "Success" (green)
- ✅ Cross-origin headers fixed
- ✅ Robots.txt updated
- ✅ All fixes deployed

Google will now index your pages!
