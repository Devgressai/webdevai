# Hawaii Hub Page - Internal Linking Plan

**Date:** January 13, 2026  
**Page:** `/locations/hawaii`  
**Strategy:** Hub-and-Spoke Model

---

## 📊 Linking Architecture

### Hub-and-Spoke Model
The Hawaii hub page acts as a **central directory** that links to both city-specific pages (Kona, Honolulu) and core service pages. This creates a strong internal linking structure for:
- **User Navigation** - Easy discovery of location-specific services
- **SEO Value** - Distributes PageRank across location and service pages
- **Topic Clustering** - Establishes Hawaii as a topical authority

```
              [Hawaii Hub]
                    |
        +-----------+-----------+
        |                       |
    [Kona Page]           [Honolulu Page]
        |                       |
        +-------+-------+-------+
                |
        [Service Pages × 6]
```

## 🎯 Anchor Text Strategy

### Primary Anchor Texts (for links TO hub)
- "Hawaii SEO services"
- "digital marketing in Hawaii"
- "serving businesses in Hawaii"
- "Oahu and Big Island"
- "Hawaiian islands"
- "Hawaii" (breadcrumb)

### Avoid
- Over-optimization ("best Hawaii SEO company")
- Exact-match spam ("Hawaii SEO Hawaii web design Hawaii")
- Generic only ("click here", "learn more")

### Best Practices
- **Variation:** Mix branded ("Webvello Hawaii"), topical ("Hawaii digital marketing"), and navigational ("Hawaii") anchors
- **Natural:** Use anchors that fit the sentence naturally
- **Descriptive:** Make anchors descriptive enough to tell users what they'll find

---

## 📈 SEO Benefits

### 1. Topic Clustering
The hub page establishes Hawaii as a topical cluster with:
- **Pillar Page:** Hawaii hub (broad overview)
- **Sub-Pages:** Kona and Honolulu (city-specific depth)
- **Support Pages:** Service pages (technical depth)

This structure signals to Google that Webvello has comprehensive expertise in Hawaii digital marketing.

### 2. Internal PageRank Flow
```
[Homepage] → [Locations Page] → [Hawaii Hub] → [Kona, Honolulu, Services]
```

The hub page receives PageRank from:
- Homepage (via /locations)
- Main locations directory
- City pages (via breadcrumbs)

And distributes it to:
- City pages (via featured cards)
- Service pages (via services grid)
- Conversion pages (via CTAs)

### 3. User Journey Optimization
**Discovery Path:**
```
User searches "Hawaii SEO" 
→ Lands on Hawaii hub 
→ Reads remote work explanation
→ Chooses Kona or Honolulu
→ Clicks through to city page
→ Converts via contact form
```

**Comparison Path:**
```
User lands on Kona page
→ Clicks Hawaii breadcrumb
→ Discovers Honolulu also available
→ Compares both cities
→ Chooses best fit
→ Converts
```

### 4. Reduced Bounce Rate
By providing clear navigation to:
- Location-specific pages
- Service details
- FAQs answering objections
- Multiple CTAs

Users stay on-site longer and explore more pages, signaling engagement to Google.

## 🔄 Cross-Linking Between City Pages

### Kona ↔ Honolulu
Currently, city pages **don't** link directly to each other. Consider adding contextual links:

**On Kona Page:**
> "Also serving Honolulu and Oahu with enterprise-grade SEO solutions. [View Honolulu services](/locations/hawaii/honolulu)."

**On Honolulu Page:**
> "Looking for Big Island SEO services? Check out our [Kona digital marketing page](/locations/hawaii/kona)."

**Benefits:**
- Helps users discover related pages
- Distributes link equity between city pages
- Reduces reliance on hub as only connector

**Placement:** After main services section, before FAQs
