## 🎯 How to Submit 200 Pages Today

### ⚠️ Important Limitation

**Google Search Console limits you to ~20 manual URL submissions per day.**

However, you can still get all 200 pages indexed faster by using the **sitemap approach** (recommended):

---

## 🌟 RECOMMENDED: Submit Sitemap (One-Time Action)

### Step 1: Submit Sitemap (Takes 5 Minutes)

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Click **"Sitemaps"** in the left sidebar
3. Enter: `sitemap.xml`
4. Click **"Submit"**
5. **Done!** ✅

This will **automatically submit ALL pages** in your sitemap (including all 200 new URLs) to Google for crawling.

**Timeline**: Google will crawl these over 1-4 weeks automatically.

---

## 📝 Alternative: Manual Submission (20 URLs/Day)

If you want to manually submit specific priority URLs:

### Daily Process (20 URLs per day)

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Click **"URL Inspection"** at the top
3. Copy the first 20 URLs from `batch-200-urls.txt`
4. For each URL:
   - Paste into URL Inspection
   - Click "Request Indexing"
   - Wait 3-5 seconds
5. Repeat tomorrow with next 20 URLs

### Use Daily Batches

Check `daily-batches.json` to see which 20 URLs to submit each day:

- **Day 1**: First 20 URLs (Jersey City + Chula Vista services)
- **Day 2**: Next 20 URLs (Buffalo + Chandler services)
- **Day 3**: Next 20 URLs (Madison + Reno services)
- ...and so on for 10 days
