        "question": "Why should Kona businesses invest in technical SEO and AI search optimization?",
        "answer": "Kona's economy depends on visitors finding your business online. 87% of travelers research online before booking. Technical SEO ensures your site loads fast, ranks high, and converts visitors. AI search optimization (GEO) gets your business cited when travelers ask ChatGPT or Perplexity about Kona activities, hotels, and services. Together, they capture both traditional Google search and the growing AI search market. Our Kona clients see an average 300% increase in qualified traffic within 6 months.",
        "category": "strategy"
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to see SEO results in Kona's competitive tourism market?",
        "answer": "Quick wins appear in 30-45 days (technical fixes, Google Business Profile optimization, local citations). Significant ranking improvements typically occur within 3-6 months. Full market dominance takes 6-12 months. Kona's tourism market is seasonal—we time optimization to maximize impact during peak visitor seasons (December-March, June-August). Local SEO shows faster results than competitive tourism keywords. We provide weekly reports so you see progress from day one.",
        "category": "timeline"
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you work with Kona businesses remotely, or do you have a local office?",
        "answer": "We work 100% remotely with Kona and Big Island businesses. No local office needed. Our team has extensive experience serving Hawaii businesses and understands the unique challenges of island markets: tourism seasonality, shipping logistics, local competition, and visitor behavior patterns. We provide the same high-quality service as a local agency through video calls, screen sharing, and real-time collaboration tools. Many of our Hawaii clients prefer remote work—no need to commute to meetings.",
        "category": "logistics"
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes Web Vello different from other SEO agencies serving Kona?",
        "answer": "Three key differentiators: (1) Technical expertise—we're engineers first, marketers second. We fix complex technical issues other agencies miss. (2) AI search optimization—we're early adopters of GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) to get you cited in ChatGPT and Perplexity. (3) Transparent reporting—real-time dashboards, weekly reports, and direct access to analytics. No black box. You see exactly what we're doing and the results we're driving. Plus, we understand Hawaii's tourism economy and seasonal patterns.",

We understand the unique SEO challenges of each industry and have proven strategies for tourism, hospitality, and local service businesses.",

Web development projects start at $5,000 for basic sites and $15,000+ for custom booking systems and e-commerce platforms. We offer flexible packages based on your goals and budget. All packages include transparent reporting and direct access to our team. Free technical audit and strategy session to start—we'll show you exactly what needs to be done and provide a custom quote.",
        "category": "pricing"

      {
        "question": "What is GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) and why does it matter for Kona businesses?",
        "answer": "GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) is optimization for AI platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google SGE. When travelers ask these AI tools \"best coffee tours in Kona\" or \"where to stay in Kailua-Kona,\" GEO ensures your business gets cited in the answer. This is critical because 40% of travelers now use AI tools for trip planning. Traditional SEO gets you ranked in Google. GEO gets you cited by AI. We optimize for both to maximize your visibility across all search channels.",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can you help with Google Business Profile optimization and review management?",
        "answer": "Yes. Google Business Profile (GBP) optimization is included in all our local SEO packages. We optimize your profile for maximum visibility in Google Maps and Local Pack results. This includes: category optimization, business description, service area setup, post scheduling, photo optimization, Q&A management, and review generation campaigns. We also provide review monitoring and response templates. GBP optimization typically shows results within 2-4 weeks and is one of the fastest ways to increase local visibility.",

        "question": "Do you guarantee first-page rankings or specific traffic increases?",
        "answer": "We don't guarantee specific rankings (no legitimate SEO agency can—Google's algorithm changes constantly). However, we do guarantee our process: comprehensive technical audits, proven optimization strategies, transparent reporting, and continuous improvement. Our Kona clients average 300% traffic growth within 6 months, 89% achieve first-page rankings for target keywords, and 95% see positive ROI within 12 months. We're so confident in our approach that we provide monthly performance reports and adjust strategies based on data. If something isn't working, we pivot immediately.",

You get access to a real-time dashboard showing all key metrics. Weekly email reports highlight wins and areas for improvement. Monthly strategy calls review performance and adjust tactics.
