### Philosophy

George approaches search optimization as a **systems problem**, not a tactical one. His background in information security and systems engineering informs his approach:

- **Entity-First**: Build clear entity signals so search systems understand who you are
- **Semantic-Native**: Organize information so systems understand topic relationships
- **Performance-Oriented**: Speed, efficiency, and measurable results
- **Systems-Thinking**: Treat discoverability as an interconnected system

### Why He Founded Webvello

George founded Webvello because he saw a gap in how companies approach search in the AI era. Most agencies optimize only for Google's blue links, but users now discover content through ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and other AI systems. Each system has different discovery mechanisms and authority signals.

His mission is to help companies build real discoverability systems that work across all modes of search—building actual authority through proper entity signals, semantic understanding, and systematic index management.

## Key Concepts Webvello Specializes In

### AI Search Optimization
A systems-oriented discipline for building discoverability across traditional search, AI-generated responses, and knowledge graphs. Combines AI SEO, AEO, and GEO with semantic architecture, entity SEO, and index governance.

### Entity SEO
The practice of establishing clear entity signals (who you are, what you're authoritative about, why you're trustworthy) so search systems—both traditional Google and AI systems—recognize you as an authoritative source.

### Index Governance
Strategic control of what pages get indexed, in what order, and with what authority signals. Concentrates crawl budget and authority on high-value pages instead of spreading thin across low-value pages.

### Programmatic SEO
Systematic generation of website pages at scale (geographic variations, service combinations, industry specifics) while maintaining uniqueness, relevance, and governance.

### Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)
Optimizing content to be cited by AI-generated responses in platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews.

### Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)
Structuring content to appear in featured snippets, answer boxes, and voice search results.
