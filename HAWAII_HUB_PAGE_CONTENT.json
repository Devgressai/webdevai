  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do you have a physical office in Hawaii?",
      "answer": "No, Webvello operates remotely, which allows us to keep costs low and deliver faster results. We serve Hawaii businesses (and clients nationwide) through video calls, project management tools, and real-time dashboards. Most of our Hawaii clients prefer this model—it's more flexible, eliminates commute time, and provides better value. You'll have a dedicated team, regular check-ins, and 24/7 access to performance dashboards."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you understand Hawaii's market if you're remote?",
      "answer": "We've worked with dozens of Hawaii businesses across Oahu, Big Island, Maui, and Kauai—from hotels and tour operators to medical practices and law firms. We research your local competitors, analyze Hawaii-specific search trends, and tailor strategies to the islands' unique visitor economy, seasonal patterns, and geo-targeted search behavior. Our remote model actually allows us to serve multiple Hawaii markets simultaneously with specialized expertise."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your onboarding process for Hawaii businesses?",
      "answer": "Simple: (1) Schedule a free 30-minute strategy call to discuss your goals. (2) We audit your site and competitors, then send a custom proposal. (3) Once approved, we hold a kick-off meeting (video), grant dashboard access, and start work immediately. Most Hawaii clients are onboarded within 3–5 business days. You'll have a dedicated project manager and weekly updates throughout the engagement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help with both Honolulu and neighbor island businesses?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We serve businesses across all Hawaiian islands—Oahu (Honolulu, Pearl City, Kailua), Big Island (Kona, Hilo), Maui (Kahului, Lahaina), Kauai (Lihue, Poipu), and more. Each island has unique market dynamics, and we tailor SEO and web strategies accordingly. Whether you're a Waikiki hotel or a Kona coffee farm, we build strategies specific to your local market."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to see SEO results in Hawaii?",
      "answer": "Most Hawaii clients see initial ranking improvements within 4–8 weeks and significant traffic growth by month 3–4. Competitive keywords (e.g., \"Honolulu lawyer\" or \"Kona hotel\") take longer, while long-tail and local keywords rank faster. We provide weekly updates and monthly reports so you can track progress in real time. SEO is a long-term investment, but Hawaii markets are less saturated than mainland cities, which often means faster results."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with Hawaii-specific industries like tourism and hospitality?",
      "answer": "Yes. We have deep experience with Hawaii's key industries: hotels, vacation rentals, tour operators, restaurants, real estate agencies, medical practices, law firms, and local service businesses. We understand the visitor economy, seasonal traffic patterns, and how to optimize for both tourists (research phase) and locals (transactional searches). Many of our Hawaii clients are in tourism and hospitality."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes Webvello different from Hawaii-based agencies?",
      "answer": "Three things: (1) Technical expertise—we're engineers first, marketers second. We fix Core Web Vitals, mobile performance, and technical SEO issues that local agencies often miss. (2) AI search optimization (GEO)—we optimize for ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google SGE, which is critical as travelers increasingly use AI to research Hawaii trips. (3) Transparent pricing and reporting—you'll always know what we're doing, why, and what results you're getting. No fluff, no long-term contracts, just results."
